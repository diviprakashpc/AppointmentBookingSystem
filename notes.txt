Remember A doctor can have many appointments. But A patient can have only one appointment. Remember before creating appointments.
(Plan Cancelled wont implement this). a user can have multiple appointments.

- Create Appointment:
Type : POST
Route : /api/appointment/Create

Request Payload : {
    userMail,
    doctorMail,
    timeSlot : {
        startTime : '',
        endTime : ''
    }

}

Response : {
    code : '200',
    msg : ' Appointment Created Successfully',
    model : null
}

Logic : 
- Check if user exists
- Check if doctor exists ( However frontend only shows list of existing doctors and patients will have brearer tokens but still for safety purpose)
- Check if both email same provided. Throw error for that case.
- Check if Patient is not doctor.
- Check if doctor specializes in the Request specialization. ( Not now )
- Check if user already has an appointment booked with the same doctor . 
- Check if timeSlot is booked or not. ( Overlapping slots )
- Create an appointment and return success.

Route : /api/appointment/viewAll?doctor='doctorEmail;

Response : {
    code : '',
    msg : '',
    model : {
        appointments : [{
            timeSlot,
            status,
            doctorName
        }] 
    }
}

- View Appointment Details :

Type : GET
Route : /api/appointment/viewAll?patient='patientEmail;

Response : {
    code : '',
    msg : '',
    model : {
        appointmentDetails : {
            doctorName : '',
            timeSlot : {
                startTime: '',
                endTime : ''
            },
            patientName : '' // This can be patient details. So can have some disease or something.
        }
    }
}

- Cancel Appointment API : 

Type : POST
Route : /api/appointment/cancel

Req : {
    patient : '' // useremail
    timeSlot : {
        startTime : '',
        endTime : ''
    },
    doctor : '' // doctor email

}

Res : {
    code : 200,
    model : null,
    msg : 'Succsess'
}

Logic : 
i) Find patient by their email.
ii) Find doctor by email.
iii) Check if appointment exist with this doctor
ii) To cancel an appointment mark the appointment status as 'Cancelled' in the appointment table.
